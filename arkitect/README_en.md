## Quickstart

### Basic Chat

1. **Install Arkitect:**

  ```Bash
  pip install arkitect --index-url https://pypi.org/simple
  ```

2. **Create an Inference** **Endpoint**: Log in to the [Ark Console](https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/endpoint?projectName=default) and create an endpoint. 
3. **Generate an API Key:** Follow the [API Key guide](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1399008#_1-获取并配置-api-key). 
4. **Create main.py**: Replace the model part in the file. The example uses `doubao-1.5-pro-32k-250115`, which you can replace with other model ID.

```Python
import os
from typing import AsyncIterable, Union

from arkitect.core.component.context.context import Context

from arkitect.types.llm.model import (
    ArkChatCompletionChunk,
    ArkChatParameters,
    ArkChatRequest,
    ArkChatResponse,
    Response,
)
from arkitect.launcher.local.serve import launch_serve
from arkitect.telemetry.trace import task


@task()
async def default_model_calling(
    request: ArkChatRequest,
) -> AsyncIterable[Union[ArkChatCompletionChunk, ArkChatResponse]]:
    parameters = ArkChatParameters(**request.__dict__)
    ctx = Context(model="doubao-1.5-pro-32k-250115", parameters=parameters)
    await ctx.init()
    messages = [
        {"role": message.role, "content": message.content}
        for message in request.messages
    ]
    resp = await ctx.completions.create(messages=messages, stream=request.stream)
    if request.stream:
        async for chunk in resp:
            yield chunk
    else:
        yield resp


@task()
async def main(request: ArkChatRequest) -> AsyncIterable[Response]:
    async for resp in default_model_calling(request):
        yield resp

if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = os.getenv("_FAAS_RUNTIME_PORT")
    launch_serve(
        package_path="main",
        port=int(port) if port else 8080,
        health_check_path="/v1/ping",
        endpoint_path="/api/v3/bots/chat/completions",
        clients={},
    )

```

5. **Set API Key and Start Server:**

```Bash
export ARK_API_KEY=<YOUR APIKEY>
python3 main.py
```

6. **Send a Request:**

```Shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/v3/bots/chat/completions' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "model": "my-bot",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Introduce yourself"}]
}'
```

### Plugin Invocation

1. **Install Arkitect:**

```Bash
pip install arkitect --index-url https://pypi.org/simple
```

2. **Create an Inference** **Endpoint**: Log in to the [Ark Console](https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/endpoint?projectName=default) and create an endpoint OR using a function-call model (e.g., Doubao-pro-32k-functioncall-241028). (For BytePlus users, please refer to [ModelArk Console](https://console.byteplus.com/ark/region:ark-stg+ap-southeast-1/endpoint?projectName=default) to create an endpoint.)
3. **Generate an API Key:** Follow the [API Key guide](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1399008#_1-获取并配置-api-key). (For BytePlus users, please refer to the  [Obtaining API Key](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/1399008#_1-obtaining-and-configuring-api-key))
4. **Create main.py**: Replace the model part in the file. The example uses `doubao-1.5-pro-32k-250115`, which you can replace with other model ID.
