  "output": "Match: No\nExplanation: The rental listing is for a 3 - bedroom HDB flat at 55 Pipit Road, with a monthly rent of S$4,000 which meets the budget requirement. However, it is near MacPherson MRT, not Tanjong Pagar MRT as per the user's preference for proximity to the office. Also, there is no mention of a tennis - court in the listing details, so it does not meet two of the user's preferences. "
