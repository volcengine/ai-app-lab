{"reasoning_output": "So, let's check the user's preferences. The user wants a place with a tennis court, monthly budget below 5000, 3 rooms, and near Tanjong Pagar MRT.\n\nFirst, the rental price is S$4,200/mo, which is below 5000. Number of bedrooms is 3, so that's good. Now, check if there's a tennis court. Looking at the common facilities section: the listed facilities are 24 hours security, Barbeque pits, Covered car park, Playground. No tennis court mentioned. So that's a miss. Also, check proximity to Tanjong Pagar MRT. The listing says it's near Kembangan and Eunos MRT, not Tanjong Pagar. So two issues: no tennis court, and not near Tanjong Pagar MRT.", "output": "Match: No\nExplanation: The listing does not have a tennis court (common facilities listed don\u2019t include a tennis court), and it is near Kembangan/Eunos MRT instead of Tanjong Pagar MRT."}
