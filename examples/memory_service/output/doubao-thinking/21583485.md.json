  "reasoning_output": "Got it, let's check the user's preferences. The user wants a place with a tennis court, monthly budget below 5000, 3 rooms, and near Tanjong Pagar MRT.\n\nFirst, the rental price: the listing says S$5,000/mo. The user's budget is below 5000, so this is exactly 5000, which might not be below. Wait, the user said \"below 5000\", so 5000 is not below. Then, number of rooms: the listing has 3 beds, so that's good. Now, near Tanjong Pagar MRT: the listing says Tanjong Pagar MRT is 10 mins walk (830m), so that's near. But the tennis court: does the property have a tennis court? Let's check the common facilities. The listing's common facilities mention Car park, but no tennis court. Also, the price is 5000 which is not below 5000. So let's list the mismatches: price is not below 5000, no info on tennis court.",
  "output": "Match: No\nExplanation: The monthly rent is S$5,000 which does not meet the \"below 5000\" budget requirement. Additionally, there is no information indicating the property has a tennis court."
