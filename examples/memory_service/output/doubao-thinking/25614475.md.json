{"reasoning_output": "Got it, let's check the user's preferences. The user wants a place with a tennis court, monthly budget below 5000, 3 rooms, and near Tanjong Pagar MRT.\n\nFirst, the rental price: the listing is S$5000/mo, which is at the upper limit but still below 5000? Wait, no, 5000 is not below 5000. Wait, the user said \"below 5000\", so 5000 is not below. Wait, the listing says S$5,000 /mo. So that's equal, not below. Then rooms: it has 3 beds, so 3 rooms. Now, near Tanjong Pagar MRT: the listing's nearest MRT is Paya Lebar MRT, which is not Tanjong Pagar. Also, check for tennis court: the common facilities listed are 24h security, BBQ pits, covered car park, jogging track. No tennis court mentioned. So let's break down each preference:\n\n1. Tennis court: Not mentioned in amenities or facilities. So no.\n2. Monthly budget below 5000: The rent is 5000, which is not below. So no.\n3. 3 rooms: It has 3 beds, so that's good.\n4. Near Tanjong Pagar MRT: The listing is near Paya Lebar MRT, not Tanjong Pagar. So no.\n\nSo multiple mismatches. Let's explain.", "output": "Match: No\nExplanation: 1. The monthly rent is S$5,000, which does not meet the \"below 5000\" budget requirement. 2. The property is near Paya Lebar MRT, not Tanjong Pagar MRT, so it does not satisfy the proximity to the office at Tanjong Pagar MRT. 3. There is no indication of a tennis court in the listed common facilities or amenities."}
