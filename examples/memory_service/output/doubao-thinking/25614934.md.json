{"reasoning_output": "So, let's check the user's preferences. The user wants a place with a tennis court, monthly budget below 5000, 3 rooms, and near Tanjong Pagar MRT.\n\nFirst, the rental price here is S$5,000/month. The user's budget is below 5000, so 5000 is not below, that's a mismatch. Also, check the number of rooms: it's 3 beds, so that's good. Now, near Tanjong Pagar MRT? The listing says it's 850m from Marine Terrace MRT, not Tanjong Pagar. So location is wrong. Also, does it have a tennis court? The common facilities listed are 24h security, multi-purpose hall, open car park, playground\u2014no tennis court mentioned. So multiple mismatches: price (exactly 5000, not below), location (near Marine Terrace not Tanjong Pagar), and no tennis court.", "output": "Match: No\nExplanation: 1. Monthly budget: The rental price is S$5,000/month, which does not meet the \"below 5000\" requirement. 2. Proximity to office: The listing is 850 m (10 mins walk) from Marine Terrace MRT, not near Tanjong Pagar MRT. 3. Tennis court: The common facilities section does not mention a tennis court."}
