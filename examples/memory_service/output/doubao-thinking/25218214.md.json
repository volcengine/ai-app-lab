  "reasoning_output": "Got it, let's check the user's preferences. The user wants a place with a tennis court, monthly budget below 5000, 3 rooms, and near Tanjong Pagar MRT.\n\nFirst, the rental price: the listing says S$4,900/mo, which is below 5000. Good. Then, number of rooms: it's a 3-bedroom unit. That matches. Now, near Tanjong Pagar MRT: the listing mentions proximity to MRTs, including Tanjong Pagar (under \"What's nearby\" and project info). Also, check if there's a tennis court. In the \"Spottiswoode Suites - Amenities & Attractions\" section, it says \"As well as a tennis court, Spottiswoode Suites also has a swimming pool...\". So that's covered.\n\nLet's verify each point:\n- Tennis court: Yes, the amenities include a tennis court.\n- Budget below 5000: 4900 is below 5000.\n- 3 rooms: It's a 3-bedroom unit.\n- Near Tanjong Pagar MRT: The project info says it's near Tanjong Pagar MRT (also, the location is in Tanjong Pagar area).\n\nSo all preferences are met.",
