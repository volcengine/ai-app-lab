{"reasoning_output": "Got it, let's check the user's preferences. The user wants a place with a tennis court, monthly budget below 5000, 3 rooms, and near Tanjong Pagar MRT.\n\nFirst, check the budget: the listing is S$4,800/mo, which is below 5000. Good.\n\nNumber of rooms: it's 3 beds, so that's 3 rooms. Good.\n\nNow, near Tanjong Pagar MRT. The listing's nearest MRTs are Dakota, Paya Lebar, Aljunied. Need to check commute to Tanjong Pagar MRT. Also, check if there's a tennis court. The common facilities listed are 24h security, covered car park, swimming pool. No tennis court mentioned. So two issues: no tennis court, and not sure about proximity to Tanjong Pagar MRT (need to check commute). But first, the tennis court: the listing doesn't mention a tennis court, so that's a mismatch. Also, the location is near Dakota, Paya Lebar, etc., not Tanjong Pagar. So even if we check commute, the primary issues are no tennis court and unclear proximity (but even if proximity was okay, no tennis court is a problem).\n\nSo match is No. Explanation: The listing has 3 rooms and monthly rent below 5000, but it does not mention a tennis court (one of the user's preferences) and the nearest MRTs are Dakota, Paya Lebar, Aljunied (not Tanjong Pagar MRT, so proximity to the user's office MRT is not confirmed to be near).", "output": "Match: No\nExplanation: The listing has 3 rooms and a monthly rent of S$4,800 (below 5000). However, it does not mention having a tennis court (a key preference), and its nearest MRT stations are Dakota, Paya Lebar, and Aljunied (not Tanjong Pagar MRT, so proximity to the user\u2019s office MRT is not met)."}
