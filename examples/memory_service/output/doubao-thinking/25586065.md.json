{"reasoning_output": "Got it, let's check the user's preferences. The user wants a place with a tennis court, monthly budget below 5000, 3 rooms, and near Tanjong Pagar MRT.\n\nFirst, the rental price: the listing says S$5,000/mo. Wait, the user's budget is below 5000, so 5000 is not below. So that's a mismatch. Also, check the number of rooms: it's 3 beds, so that's good. Now, near Tanjong Pagar MRT? The listing's nearest MRT is Queenstown MRT, which is not Tanjong Pagar. Also, does it have a tennis court? The amenities mentioned are car park, swimming pool, gym, etc. No tennis court mentioned. So multiple mismatches: price (5000 is not below), location (near Queenstown not Tanjong Pagar), and no tennis court.", "output": "Match: No\nExplanation: 1. Monthly budget: The rental price is S$5,000/mo, which does not meet the \"below 5000\" requirement. 2. Proximity to office: The nearest MRT is Queenstown MRT, not Tanjong Pagar MRT. 3. Tennis court: The listed common facilities (car park, swimming pool, etc.) do not include a tennis court."}
