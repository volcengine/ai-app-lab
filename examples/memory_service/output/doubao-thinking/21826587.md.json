  "reasoning_output": "Got it, let's check the user's preferences. The user wants a place with a tennis court, monthly budget below 5000, 3 rooms, and near Tanjong Pagar MRT.\n\nFirst, the rental price is S$4,500/mo, which is below 5000. The number of rooms is 3, so that's good. Now, check if there's a tennis court. Looking at the common facilities section, it lists playground and swimming pool, but no tennis court. So that's a miss. Then, proximity to Tanjong Pagar MRT: the listing says it's near Kembangan MRT (7 mins walk), not Tanjong Pagar. So two things: no tennis court, and not near Tanjong Pagar MRT. Also, need to confirm if the info about tennis court is missing. The listing's amenities and common facilities don't mention a tennis court, so we can assume it doesn't have one.",
  "output": "Match: No\nExplanation: 1. Lacks a tennis court (common facilities list playground and swimming pool, no tennis court mentioned). 2. Not near Tanjong Pagar MRT (nearest MRT is Kembangan MRT)."
